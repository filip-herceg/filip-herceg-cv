This folder holds small, reusable visual primitives to compose stunning visuals with low coupling.

Principles:
- Keep components opt-in (client-only only when necessary).
- Props-first: basic, composable primitives.
- No external state.

Suggested usage:
- Drop these into pages/sections where you want motion or layered effects.
